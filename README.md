# Ansible Playbook: Disk Partitioning and Mounting

This Ansible playbook is designed to partition, format, and mount block devices on EC2 instances. It can be used standalone or in conjunction with Terraform code (`ec2-create-attach`) that creates EC2 instances, volumes, and attaches volumes to instances.

## Usage

### With Terraform Integration

1. Clone the `ec2-create-attach` repository into your local environment.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of the `ec2-create-attach` repository to provision your infrastructure using Terraform.
3. Use the inventory file generated by Terraform as input for the Ansible playbook.

### Standalone Usage

If you're not using Terraform to provision EC2 instances and volumes, you can still use this playbook by adjusting it for your environment.

- Modify the playbook (`your_playbook.yaml`) to match your requirements, such as specifying different block devices or hostnames.
- Ensure that the block devices and hostnames are properly defined in your Ansible inventory file.

## Requirements

1. Parted version 1.8.3 and above. Parted is part of the `community.general` collection. To install it, use: `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`.
2. `ansible.posix` collection. To install it, run: `ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix`.

## Notes

- The playbook assumes the use of Amazon Linux instances. If you're using a different Linux distribution, you may need to adjust the tasks accordingly.
- Make sure to replace placeholder values with the appropriate values for your environment.
- The `block_devices` variable in the inventory file should contain the last letter of each block device name as obtained from the Terraform code to ensure dynamic partitioning.
- We welcome your feedback and encourage you to report any issues or suggestions for improvement.
